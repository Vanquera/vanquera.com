			<p>Evitt Felton is one of the many authors and historians of Vanquera. 
			His expeditions across Vanquera in an effort to document his findings have contributed greatly to many nations. 
			His published works include Encyclopedia Mechanica Animalia, Mana Deities of Vanquera, and Encyclopedia Animalia.</p>
			<h2>Personality</h2>
			<h3>Fearless</h3>
			<p>Evitt Felton has put himself into the face of danger an untold many times throughout his adventures. 
			He feels the need to chronicle Vanquera far exceeds his own wellness, and as such has quite possibly come close to death more than anyone ever documented. 
			He says on multiple occasions that he has long lost his sense of self-preservation and any fears attached to it, claiming it was likely something attained from his time in the Invardium Militia Legion. 
			How he survives every perilous encounter as a non-Mana Caster is nothing short of miraculous.</p>
			<h3>Persistent</h3>
			<p>Evitt Felton had always been of the stubborn sort, unrelenting in his values, ideals, and pursuits. 
			His persistence carried him not only through his time in the Militia, but even permeated throughout his career as an author. 
			Evitt had long desired for one of his works to make it big in the writing space, but none of them ever got the attention he so desired. 
			That didn't stop him, though at times it did discourage him. He would continue publishing a great many works, until eventually Encyclopedia Mechanica Animalia came about. 
			Evitt didn't expect it to catch on, as he had primarily published it to spread the word, perhaps even have it taught in a school or two. 
			Evitt wasn't particularly proud of the initial work, going on to publish Mana Deities of Vanquera and Encyclopedia Animalia with a higher standard for the quality.</p>
