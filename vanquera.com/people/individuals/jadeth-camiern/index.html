			<p>Jadeth Camiern was the founder of Invardia and leader of the Invardium Militia.</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>From an early age, Jadeth Camiern's mastery over Mana was evident to all. He far surpassed even those who were several years his senior, outperforming them in virtually every metric there was. He was quick, intelligent, and possessed a wisdom his peers wouldn't grasp until much older.

			In his late adolescence, Jadeth managed to singlehandedly slay a Mana Deity that was threatening his home. The creature had already slaughtered his friend and younger sister earlier that day, so Jadeth saw it fit to put the beast down. The fight was long, nearly ending with Jadeth losing his arm and, in turn, his life, but he came out on top.

			Seeing his great success, his fellow villagers wished to make him leader. Realizing the far from ideal living conditions of his current home, Jadeth sought to journey off into the world with his followers in search of a better, safer place to settle. By this time, Jadeth was in his early thirties.

			After a lengthy and treacherous journey, Jadeth and his followers found themselves beneath the home of the White Lady; a grand lake of Mana that had been collecting for at least a few decades, if not much longer. Understanding the power he could harness, he knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this was the best place they could possibly stay. The supply of Mana afforded to them seemed to be infinite. They called this new home Invardia.

			As fortunate as they had been in finding such a place, their tribulations were far from over. Jadeth was not the only one who realized the grand potential of the Mana; His people were not the only ones who had sought it. Mechabeast and Mana Deity alike wished to make use of the place, forcing Jadeth and his cohorts to fend them off. Many died in these early days, but the pain slowly eased as the people became not only more accustomed to the region, but constructed more defendable structures.

			Jadeth's entourage was referred to as the Militia, a powerful force of men and women who sought to protect their home with their lives. Jadeth's closest friends would go on to execute his vision for a grand empire, each one dying in defense of their homeland. They founded the Jadeth Council, who continue to contribute to Invardia's future.
			
			In the years after his death, Invardia has found a number of ways to celebrate his contributions to Vanquera. They would name the day of his death as Camernia. The Jadeth Council would construct a statue of gold in his honor in the courtyards of the Jadeth Council building.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Personality</h1>
			<p>Looking through what remains of Mana records, Jadeth Camiern could be described as quiet and thoughtful. Some have even called him reserved.

			Jadeth's relationship with sports was troubled, as Jadeth did not enjoy being a spectator of professional sports players. He saw it as somewhat wasteful in that it served as little more than entertainment. He could see the value in it, but could not bring himself to like it. He pretended for the sake of his people as best he could, but, as would come to be revealed later, he secretly found it boring and unnecessary at times.
			</p>
			<h1>Relations</h1>
			<h2>Followers</h2>
			<div class="quote"><p>
			Jadeth was a remarkable man. Well-spoken, powerful, and possessed an intelligent mind. Had I not known him in life, I would agree with you. But yes, Jadeth Camiern truly was as good of a man as he is described, if not better.

			<h2>The White Lady</h2>
			<p>
			Some believed that later in Jadeth's life, the White Lady formed an interpersonal relationship with Jadeth. Some speculate it to have been romantic in nature, while others theorized it to be more like a mother-son relationship. The claims are unclear as some of those who succeeded Jadeth corroborated the claims while others denied it.
