			<p>If you're new to the world of Vanquera and its community, welcome! We're glad to have you join us on this expedition!
			<br><br>
			This article exists to serve as an introduction to the ever-expanding and deepening world of Vanquera. It is not exhaustive, as it is meant to ease you into the rich lore Vanquera has to offer. If you want a more comprehensive deep-dive into any of the concepts mentioned, all you need to do is click the links beneath the corresponding header. For most, they should be a blue-ish color.
			<br><br>
			With that out of the way, let's get to exploring!</p>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>So, what is Vanquera even about? The Vanquera project is about a world teetering on the edge of its return to discordant anguish. Each and every waking moment, threats loom in darkness unseen, awaiting their opportune moment to strike. The many competing factions of Vanquera each fear - or in some cases actively strive for - the return of chaos. They are defined by the Era of Adversity that was put to an indefinite end but only a few centuries ago, the bloodshed and misery still ever-present in the minds of those who had seen it first hand. Should the denizens of Vanquera wish to keep their temporary state of relative peace and calm, they must work together and cooperate, else turmoil find itself commonplace once again.</p>
			<h3>Magic and technology; one and the same</h3>
			<p>Vanquera stands at the crossroads of science-fiction and fantasy, its technology defined by the magic system all are subject to. The distinction between the two is blurred as they share a source that defines the course of civilizations. This source is of great potency and commonality, but remains volatile and unpredictable. Its applications are potentially infinite, with the only limitation being the task of taming it.</p>
			<h3>Meta</h3>
			<p>As a work, Vanquera is a collaborative worldbuilding project founded in 2021 by me, Nightmare3711. It is intended to function like the SCP Foundation.
			All are welcome to contribute and expand upon existing concepts, including the large variety of locations, technology, objects, characters, organizations, etc.</p>
			<h1>The Central Conflict</h1><p>
In the world of Vanquera, a great catastrophe occurred that erased much of Vanquera's history. This conflict is called the Era of Adversity. It lasted an untold amount of time, causing an unknown number of deaths to not just individual people, but entire species. Plants, animals, Mechabeast, and even different species of people disappeared from history, with the only proof of their existence being vague references from sources that barely managed to survive. The Era of Adversity was perpetuated by Mana Deities, Mechabeast, Celestials, and even people. With the founding of Invardia, the Era of Adversity is considered to have concluded.

Post Era of Adversity, Vanquerans work day and night to ensure nothing brings about another worldwide catastrophe, but that hasn't stopped some from trying to bring about its return. It seems as though a world-ending threat looms around every corner, awaiting its time to strike. Some may be dormant far underground, slowly collecting power. Others might be working more out in the open, cultivating cults who will act when commanded. Others might be amassing armies of their own. And to those finding these looming threats, not only must they be burdened with the knowledge of something waiting to take over the world, but they also find themselves in positions where they must prune whatever tendrils they find. That is the core of Vanquera, and those who fear a second coming of this Era are the beating heart of this world. Everything is built around this idea.

Foundational Concepts
The following are all of the foundational concepts that you must know if you wish to understand Vanquera. These concepts are regularly referenced and linked to all throughout this wiki. Trust us when we say that without this foundational knowledge, nothing discussed elsewhere will make sense.

Mana
Mana is a substance that is the source of all sentient life, technology, and magic in Vanquera. It exists in multiple forms, both tangible and intangible. It can be absorbed and expelled by living beings.

The following are some of the most noteworthy applications for Mana in Vanquera:

Mechabeast
Mechabeast are mechanical animals that take on many appearances. They can be made of any substance and be virtually any shape or size. They, like any other living creature, are considered alive thanks to Mana. They exist alongside other animals.

Mana Deities
Mana Deities are beings that have been transformed by Mana, making them into chimerical creatures with great power.

Mana Casters
Mana Casters are people who make use of Mana to manipulate the world. They exist along a spectrum, from weak Mana Casters who can only use so much Mana at a time, to some of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen.

Swaybrands
Swaybrands are a type of weapon that are made by powerful Mana Casters. They are considered more than just weapons, but works of art. Organizations are built around Swaybrands, namely that of the Swordswayer Brotherhood who exist as a collective whose purpose is to regulate the activities of their fellow Brethren.

Other
There are, of course, many, many more applications for Mana than what has been listed here. I encourage you to explore and discover for yourself what Vanquera's magic system has to offer, and possibly contribute some applications of your own.

Celestials
The Celestials were the gods of Vanquera, seemingly capable of enacting whatever it is they so wished. They disappeared long ago without explanation.

Cultures
Invardia
Invardia is arguably the most advanced nation throughout all of Vanquera. Their power is derived from the ever-generous White Lady, who provides an infinite supply of Mana to the people. How and why does she do this? We'll get to that soon enough...

The Jadeth Council
The Jadeth Council are a group of individuals selected by the people of Invardia (and in some rare cases, currently standing members of the Council) to serve on their behalf. They undergo a process to ensure they act for their people and not against.

Invardia's Noble Houses
In addition to the Jadeth Council, all those to have ever been inducted into the Jadeth Council, as well as their offspring, are considered Invardium Nobility. Each new inductee starts their own House, assuming their last name as the House name. Houses play a significant role not just in Invardium politics, but in greater Vanquera politics as well.

Equavir
Equavir is a nation with a history drenched in warfare. They like to use Mechabeast for just about anything they can, from transportation to housing. Their culture is heavily influenced by the flowers of their home region, being used to discern those of royal blood from those of the commonfolk.

Individuals
This section regards all individual named characters of significance. Vanquera has a lot of established characters already, and so I won't bore you with all of them. I'll only list individuals of great significance to Vanquera's greater lore and story.

Evitt Felton
Evitt Felton is a non-Mana Caster whose thorough documentation of Vanquera's many mysteries has brought about a revolution of knowledge across the world.

Jadeth Camiern
Being the founder of arguably the most powerful empire Vanquera has ever seen is no small task. Jadeth Camiern, a highly skilled Mana Caster from even his earliest years, worked tirelessly each waking moment to ensure his people could find the haven they so deserved. He searched far and wide, until eventually he discovered the White Lady and her generously unending supply of Mana. His followers worked alongside him, founding the then burgeoning nation of Invardia.

The White Lady
The White Lady is considered to be the most powerful Mana Deity in all of Vanquera. She lies dormant in the Equawood Tree, providing a seemingly endless supply of Mana to the inhabitants of Vanquera.

The Thaofosho Sisters
The Thaofosho Sisters are some of the most powerful Mana Casters Vanquera has ever seen. They are beloved by their people as bastions of generosity and kindness. They each possess a unique intelligence that they use in service of their people. They are selfless in all things, never thinking about themselves above their people.
