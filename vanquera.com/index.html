			<p class="special-quote">&ensp;Vanquera is infamously known to withhold innumerable secrets from its inhabitants. Unearthing them is better said than done, as some truths are so buried no mere shovel can dig them up.<br>
			&ensp; Despite this, there are those that seek the absolute truth above all else, risking life and limb in the pursuit of veracity. They travel far and wide, speaking with anyone they can about Vanquera's lost history. There is much working against them.<br><br>
			&ensp; This is a compendium of what these individuals have discovered and documented. These are the legends of Vanquera.</p>
